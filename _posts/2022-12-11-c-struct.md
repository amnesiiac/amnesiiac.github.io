### # definition 
The array in c only accepts variable of same type, yet the struct in c could accept different types of member. 

A typical definition of struct in c is like:
```c
struct tag {
    member1;
    member2;
    // ...
} variable1, variable2;  // >=1 variable is permitted
```
In general, at least 2 of the above 3 elements should be provided in struct definition: 
```c
// def sample#1
struct {            // no tag provided
    int a;          // member list
    char b;
    double c;
} obj;              // variable list;
```
Another form of struct definition:
```c
// def sample#2
struct SIMPLE {     // tag
    int a;          // member list
    char b;
    double c;
}
// variables of SIMPLE type
struct SIMPLE t1;
struct SIMPLE t2[10];  // arr of SIMPLE
struct SIMPLE* t3;     // pointer to SIMPLE
```
Note: the above 2 definition are not the same type:
```c
struct SIMPLE* t3 = &obj; // invalid: type miss-match
```
Using typedef for struct type definition:
```c
typedef struct {
    int a;
    char b;
    double c;
} SIMPLE2;
// we could define variable types using SIMPLE2 as type identifier
SIMPLE2 t1;
SIMPLE2 t2[10];
SIMPLE2* t3;
```

### # expanded Usages
The following defines a struct contains a pointer to the its own type obj, which is suitable to create a LIST structure:
```c
struct Node {
    char str[100];
    struct Node* next;
}
```
Define 2 structs contains each other, the first reference struct should be declared before use:
```c
struct B;
struct A{
    struct B* ptr_b;
}
struct B{
    struct A* ptr_a;
}
```

<hr>

### # initialization of Struct
```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Books{
    char title;
    char author;
    char subject[100];
    int book_id;
} book_obj = {"C programming", "Melon", "programming, self-learning", 15}

int main{
    printf("title: %s\n author: %s\n subject: %s\n bookid: %s\n", 
        book_obj.title, book_obj.author, book_obj.subject, book_obj.book_id);
    return 0;
}
```
