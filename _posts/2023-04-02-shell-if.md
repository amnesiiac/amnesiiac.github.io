### difference between [] and [[]]
usages of []: <br>
$1 mind the spaces between [] and test expression <br>
$2 mind the spaces between test expression operand && operator
```shell
# (right) output: !=
if [ "a" == "b" ]; then
    echo "="
else
    echo "!="
fi
# (wrong) output: =, "a"=="b" is interpreted as "a==b"
if [ "a"=="b" ]; then
    echo "="
else
    echo "!="
fi
```
$3 < and > comparison operator should escaped as \\< and \\>
```shell
# (right) output: <
if [ "a" \> "b" ]; then
    echo ">"
else
    echo "<"
fi
# (wrong) output: >, the > is interpreted as redirect operand
if [ "a" > "b" ]; then
    echo ">"
else
    echo "<"
fi
```
$4 the string in [] && the var in ${} should be coupled with double quotes
```shell
if [ "a" == "b" ]; then
    :
fi
# use "${var}" but not ${var}, the first way could help debug program when var is undefined
```
$4 [] is a shell built-in cmd <br>

usages of [[]]:
$1 mind the spaces between [[]] and inner expression <br>
$2 mind the spaces between inner expression operand && operator
```shell
# (right) output: !=
if [[ "a" == "b" ]]; then
    echo "="
else
    echo "!="
fi
# (wrong) output: =, "a"=="b" is interpreted as "a==b"
if [[ "a"=="b" ]]; then
    echo "="
else
    echo "!="
fi
```
#3 < and > operator used in [[]] do not need the escape:
```shell
[[ "a" < "b" ]] && echo "<"    # output: <
[[ "c" > "b" ]] && echo ">"    # output: >
```
$4 [[]] support meta character wildcard match when no double quota enclosed, [] does not support this:
```shell
[[ "ab" == a* ]] && echo "ok"   # output: ok, ab started with a
[ "ab" == a* ] && echo "ok"     # output: , ab is not equal with a*
[ "a*" == a* ] && echo "ok"     # output: ok
```
$5 [[]] support logical operation like && and ||
```shell
var_arr=(1 "bee" "tee" 3 4)
if [[ ${var_arr[0]} -eq 1 && (${var_arr[1]}=="bee" || ${var_arr[2]}=="tee") ]]; then
    echo "logical combinations: fit the condition"
fi
```
$6 [[]] is shell keyword, not a build-in function


### samples
if-elif-else-fi
```shell
name="john"
if [ $name=="john" ]; then
    echo "plain condition: it's john"
elif [ $name=="melon" ]; then
    echo "plain condition: it's melon"
else
    echo "plain condition: it's others"
fi
```

test a condition true or false
```shell
# [] means 'test' function => test expression
if [ ! $# -lt 1 ]; then
    num_of_params $*
fi
```

check the existence of certain word in file
```shell
# the grep -q already invokes 'test', so cannot use if [ grep -q...]
if grep -q 'foo' /home/metung/test/s.sh; then
    echo "You appear to have typed 'foo' in the script"
fi
```
