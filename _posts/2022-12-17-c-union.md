### # definition 
Union is a special data structure which enables storing different type of data in the same memory address. Thus at any time, only one member in union is initialized with values.
```c
union union_tag{    // the tag is a optional
    member1;        // member definition list
    member2;
    // ...
    membern;
} union_var1, union_var2...; // variable list
```
For example, the following defines a union taged Data. Note that in union definition, the tag is optional.
```c
union Data{
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
} data;
```
Then the union data could be used for storing an int or a float number or a char array.

### # memory model of union
The union is compiled to be able to hold the maximum spaces needed to hold every member in its member list. The above union data will take up 20 bytes of memory. 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

union Data{ // definition
     int i;
     float f;
     char str[20];
} data;

int main(){
    union Data data; // declaration
    printf("the size occupied by data is %lu\n", sizeof(data)); // unsigned long
    return 0;
}
```

<hr>

### # access to union Member
The operator `.` is used to get access to union members:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

union Data{
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
} data;

int main(){
    union Data data;
    data.i = 0;
    data.f = 1.23;
    strcpy(data.str, "c programming");
    printf("data.i: %d\n", data.i);
    printf("data.f: %f\n", data.f);
    printf("data.str: %s\n", data.str);
    return 0;
}
```
```txt
data.i: 1919950947
data.f: 4756195551848466478234509246464.000000
data.str: c programming
```
The value of data.i and data.f is spoiled by the last assigned variable data.str, which is a proof of: "the union variable is only occupied by one of its members at a time".

### # application
If we make sure that two fields in one data structure are mutually exclusive, then we could try to declare the two fields in one union but not struct, in order to save memory usage.

(1) In low-level system programming, unions bit mode could enable us to break down hardware register into component bits:
```c
// struct in union: register bits mode
typedef union{
    unsigned char control_byte;
    struct{
        unsigned int nibble  :4;
        unsigned int nmi     :1;
        unsigned int enable  :1;
        unsigned int fired   :1;
        unsigned int control :1;
    };
} control_register;
```
(2) union can be used for reinterpret the binary memory of one type to another:
```c
union{
    int i;
    float f;
} data;

data.f = 3.14159f;
printf("the float memory denotes integer: %08x \n", data.i);
```
(3) union can be used in pseudo-polymorphism situations:
```c
// union in struct: polymorphsim
enum type{INT, FLOAT, DOUBLE};
struct cache{
    type t;
    union{
        int int_var[2];
        float float_var[2];
        double double_var;
    }
}

cache sample;
switch(sample->t){ // pseudo-polymorphism
    case INT:
        operation(sample->int_var);
        break;
    case FLOAT:
        operation(sample->float_var);
        break;
    case DOUBLE:
        operation(sample->double_var);
        break;
}
```
(4) union could be used for judging big-endian machine or little endian machine: <br>

### # union data alignment (csapp 3.93)

when using union, sometimes byte-ordering issues is important.
```c
double uu2double(unsigned word0, unsigned word1){
    union{
        double d;
        unsigned int u[2];
    } tmp;
    tmp.u[0] = word0;  // low 8 bits
    tmp.u[1] = word1;  // high 8 bits
    return tmp;
}
```
if in little endian machine, the above code work as assumed, but in big endian machine, the result is just the opposite.
