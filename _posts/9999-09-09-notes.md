1 computatively-intensively field + knowledge based + experience involved area is better job choice.

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

2 work for money, learn for knowledge, knowledge is for money.

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

3 when someone try through tasks to you but you dont understand it, then two choice left to you:  
a) find someone who knows the details or knows the person is responsible for this to hand the job over; 
b) if you are responsible for this task but you dont understand, you can get a quick response,
and then slowly learn & make changes accordingly.

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

4 tech wont make money for you, but product does, tech can keep a corporation outstanding, but dont rely on it,
rely on the product & the service you offer to your customer.

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

5 learn to close you eyes when typing, which will exercise your brain and saving your eys.

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

6 a expert engineer must have the sense of providing solution to general usecase (past & present & incoming),
dont write stupid & unscalable code which make the project fragile.

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

7 if some books & lecture & articles & knowledge & code is really hard for you to understand, just read it over and
over till you nearlly recite it, if no progress on understanding them, just let it go, a fews days later you can
pick up them again, the viewpoint & inspiration will come.

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

8 when designing & making translation unit or utiliy wrapper for certain project, there's no harm in abstracting
them into a solely workable unit.
there best has no dependancy between different unit in your project, so as each unit can be used for other project
as distributable package or crate.

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

9 when drown in the basic maintainence tasks, it's very imperative to conclude the root cause: why you cannot
solve this task as a whole, what you can do solve the problem at root, so that same problem wont happen anymore.
e.g., contact with the boss to change the workflow, do some proactive software to prevent all subsequent bugs\...
just dont focus on the problem itself, jump out of it to solve it on high level.

### # interview miscelleneous conclusion
1 in linux paging policy: for i386 (x86) is two-level paging like 10-10-12, while x86_64 paging follows four-level
as 9-9-9-9-12, why x86_64 paging is designed to be 9 rather than legacy 10?

because, the address bit width of x86 & x86_64 are different: x86 is 32bit=4B, 1 page can store 4KB/4B=1024
addresses, that is 10bit; however, x86_64 is 64bit=8B, 1 page can store 4KB/8B=512 addresses (9bit).
hence, using 9bits for each page can enable retrieve the addr-mapping within 1 page-fault.
