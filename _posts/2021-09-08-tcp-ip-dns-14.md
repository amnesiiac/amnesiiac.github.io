the dns is a distributed database based on tcp/ip app.
services provided by dns: conversion between hostname and ip addr, and providing routing info for email.

dns is a distributed system.
each site on the internet cannot hold all dns mapping info, instead, each site save it own database
and maintain a server for other host on the internet to query.
ways to access the dns database: access the dns server through the addr resolver.
in unix, the addr resolver can be called through two api: gethostbyname() and getnamebyhost().

addr resolution service belong to the application layer.
addr resolver belong to the operation of the application layer, rather than the tcp/ip stack in kernel.
before app attempt to establish a tcp connection or send a datagram by udp,
addr resolution is needed to retrieve ip addr by hostname.
the tcp/ip protocol stack know nothing about the dns service.

this article focus on using the tcp/ip (mainly udp) to communicate with the dns name server,
but wont describe the implementation details about dns server itself.

rfc-1034 describes the basic concepts and functions of dns.
rfc-1035 describes the specification and implementation of dns.
