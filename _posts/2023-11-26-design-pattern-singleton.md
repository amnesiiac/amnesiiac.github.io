$ 1 what is thread safety?  
in programs where multiple threads share data and are executed in parallel,
thread-safe code will ensure that each thread can be executed correctly
by the synchronization mechanism to avoid data pollution.

$ 2 how to ensure thread safety?  
@1 add lock for shared resources, to ensure shared variable are only taken up by one thread each time.  
@2 provide exclusive resources for each thread, rather than shared one.
e.g. thread_local can alleviate race condition by maintaining exclusive variable for each thread,
a cpp example illustraing this is as:

```text
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <string>
#include <thread>

using std::cout; using std::endl;

thread_local unsigned int rage = 1;                            // thread-local var
std::mutex cout_mutex;                                         // mutex
 
void increase_rage(const std::string &thread_name){
    ++rage;                                                    // modify out of mutex lock is okay for thread-local var
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(cout_mutex);              // lock the mutex
    cout << "rage counter for " << thread_name << ": " << rage << endl;
}
 
int main(){
    std::thread a(increase_rage, "a"), b(increase_rage, "b");  // create thread with associated func
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(cout_mutex);          // lock the mutex for this separate scope
        cout << "rage counter for main: " << rage << endl;     // ensure following code block exec exclusively
    }
    a.join();                                                  // wait for thread a finishing
    b.join();                                                  // wait for thraed b finishing
}
```

the output can be like:

```text
rage counter for main: 1
rage counter for b: 2
rage counter for a: 2
```

examine the usage of brackets arround std::lock_guard in main, try get rid of it by:

```text
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <string>
#include <thread>

using std::cout; using std::endl;

thread_local unsigned int rage = 1;                            // thread-local var
std::mutex cout_mutex;                                         // mutex
 
void increase_rage(const std::string &thread_name){
    ++rage;                                                    // modify out of mutex lock is okay for thread-local var
    cout_mutex.lock();                                         // lock
    cout << "rage counter for " << thread_name << ": " << rage << endl;
    cout_mutex.unlock();                                       // unlock
}
 
int main(){
    std::thread a(increase_rage, "a"), b(increase_rage, "b");  // create thread with associated func
 
    cout_mutex.lock();                                         // lock
    cout << "rage counter for main: " << rage << endl;         // ensure following code block exec exclusively
    cout_mutex.unlock();                                       // unlcok
 
    a.join();                                                  // wait for thread a finishing
    b.join();                                                  // wait for thraed b finishing
}
```

that is, the bracket arround std::lock_guard is like the with statement in python, which
enable automatically releasing lock the end of the scope.

â—† why we need singleton pattern?  
sometimes it is important to ensure that there is only one instance living of certain classes.
e.g. operating system can only have one system clock; there existed multiple printing tasks
in the printer system, but only one is for executing.

<hr>

### # singleton pattern
$ 1 definition of singleton  
@1 a singleton can only have one instance.  
@2 a singleton must create the instance by itself.  
@3 a singleton must maintain method for exposing the instance to outside.

$ 2 categories of singleton  
the singleton can be classified into lazy mode and hungry mode.
@1 lazy mode: there's no instance existed in thread context, the instance is only created
when a thread need to; extra effort is needed to make it thread-safe.  
@2 hungry mode: init the instance at the thread context, when a thread need it,
just use the instance in the thread context; naturally thread-safe method.

$ 3 feature of singleton  
@1 ctor and dtor are private, prevent construct & destory instance out of class context.  
@2 copy-ctor and value-assign-ctor are private, prevent instance creation by them out of class.  
@3 a static method to access the instance, which is accessible out of the class.

$ 4 application scenarios of lazy & hungry mode  
lazy singleton: suitable to be applied in low-access traffic scenarios; the local static version is
preferred among other lock/unlock methods.  
hungry singleton: suitable to be applied in high-access traffic scenarios.

### # lazy singleton pattern (thread-unsafe)

```text
#include <iostream>
#include <pthread.h>

using std::cout; using std::endl;

class SingleInstance{
private:
    static SingleInstance* ptr_single_instance;                  // static member: no this
private:
    SingleInstance();                                            // ctor
    ~SingleInstance();                                           // dtor
    SingleInstance(const SingleInstance&);                       // copy ctor
    const SingleInstance& operator=(const SingleInstance&);      // assign op
public:
    static SingleInstance* get_instance();                       // static instance access api
    static void delete_instance();                               // static release instance resource 
    void print();
};

SingleInstance* SingleInstance::ptr_single_instance = nullptr;   // static data member must init ouside

SingleInstance* SingleInstance::get_instance(){                  // thread-unsafe creation without lock
                                                                 // multiple threads judge ptr=nullptr concurrently
    if(ptr_single_instance == nullptr){                          // if ptr to instance is null (no instance created)
        ptr_single_instance = new(std::nothrow) SingleInstance;  // no throw err if allocation failed (by ctor)
    }
    return ptr_single_instance;
}

void SingleInstance::delete_instance(){                          // destory instance by dtor
    if(ptr_single_instance){                                     // if instance exist, destory it
        delete ptr_single_instance;
        ptr_single_instance = nullptr;
    }
}

void SingleInstance::print(){                                    // print info
    cout << "instance memory address: " << this << endl;
}

SingleInstance::SingleInstance(){                                // ctor
    cout << "invoking ctor" << endl;
}

SingleInstance::~SingleInstance(){                               // dtor
    cout << "invoking dtor" << endl;
}
```

the lazy singleton class usecase, which introduce memory leakage in concurrency:

```text
void* printhello(void *thread_id_p){
    pthread_detach(pthread_self());                       // thread start as detached mode (no care of its end state)

    int thread_id = *((int*)thread_id_p);                 // type conversion: void* -> int* -> int
    cout << "thread id: [" << thread_id << "]" << endl;
    SingleInstance::get_instance()->print();              // create singleton instance & print addr

    pthread_exit(nullptr);                                // thread end (os is responsible for resource releasing)
}

const int NUM_THREADS = 5;                                // use const int rather than #define

int main(){
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS] = {0};                                            // thread_t arr
    int index[NUM_THREADS] = {0};                                                    // index arr
    int ret = 0; int i = 0;

    cout << "main function start" << endl;
    for(int i=0; i<NUM_THREADS; ++i){                                                // 5 concurrenct th
        cout << "main(): create threads: [" << i << "]" << endl;
        index[i] = i;
        ret = pthread_create(&threads[i], nullptr, printhello, (void*)&(index[i]));  // int -> void*
        if(ret){                                                                     // err check
            cout << "error: cannot create threads" << endl;
            exit(-1);
        }
    }
    SingleInstance::delete_instance();                    // intend to release singleton resource, but 2 was created
    cout << "main function end" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

possible output of above program can be:

```text
main function start
main(): create threads: [0]
main(): create threads: [1]
main(): create threads: [2]
thread id: [main(): create threads: [3]0]
thread id: [2]
invoking ctor
instance memory address: 0x7fcbd4405a80    // 1
invoking ctor
instance memory address: 0x7fcbd4504080    // 2
thread id: [
1]
instance memory address: 0x7fcbd4504080    // 3 (addr same as 2)
thread id: [3]
instance memory address: 0x7fcbd4504080    // 4 (addr same as 2)
main(): create threads: [4]
invoking dtor
main function end
thread id: [4]
invoking ctor
instance memory address: 0x7fcbd4504080    // 5 (addr same as 2)
```

the above program intend to create a singleton, but typically 2 instances are created
(only got 2 kinds of addr), obj creation from other threads is failed with std::bad_alloc,
but the exception is handled by std::nothrow version of new.
finally, the program try release the singleton resource, leading to memory leak.

$ 1 why lazy mode singleton is not thread-safe?  
if the concurrently running thread access the ptr==nullptr judging at the same time,
then some of them might think as no singleton created yet, leading to duplicate obj creation.

$ 2 how to avoid resource leaking?  
RAII (resource aquisition is initialization) can avoid memory leak in the above program:
when creating objects, the ctor is responsible for resource aquisition, e.g.
allocating memory, opening files, connecting to a network, etc.
when destorying objects, the dtor is responsible for resource release, e.g.
during normal exit, exception, or early return.

another way to avoid memory leak is conducted in above program: claim the thread as
detached, thus left the recycle operation to os.

$ 3 linux pthread state: detached or joinable?  
there are 2 state of linux pthread: joinable and detached. when thread is set/created as
joinable, then no recycle of thread stack & thread id at the time of exec return or
pthread_exit() to exit. when thread is set/created as detached, the thread resouce will
be released by os when exit.

$ 4 which linker option to use for managing threads: pthread or lpthread?  
both can be used for compilation of above program, but lpthread is only worked for linker,
while the pthread can worked on both pre-processor & linker. thus the pthread is recommended.

the makefile for the above program can be:

```text
CXX=g++
CFLAGS=-g -Wall -std=c++11 -pthread -w
OUT=out

SUBDIR=$(shell ls -d */)

ROOTSRC=$(wildcard *.cpp)
ROOTOBJ=$(ROOTSRC:%.cpp=%.o)

SUBSRC=$(shell find $(SUBDIR) -name '*.cpp')
SUBOBJ=$(SUBSRC:%.cpp=%.o)

$(OUT):$(ROOTOBJ) $(SUBOBJ)
	$(CXX) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^
.cpp.o:
	$(CXX) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

.PHONY:clean all
clean:
	rm -f *.o $(OUT) $(ROOTOBJ) $(SUBOBJ)
```

### # lazy singleton pattern with lock (thread-safe)
singleton with lock class definition:

```text
#include <iostream>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <mutex>

using std::cout; using std::endl;

class SingleInstance{
private:
    static SingleInstance* ptr_single_instance;                      // static member: no this
    static std::mutex singleton_mutex;                               // mutex
private:
    SingleInstance();                                                // ctor
    ~SingleInstance();                                               // dtor
    SingleInstance(const SingleInstance&);                           // copy ctor
    const SingleInstance& operator=(const SingleInstance&);          // assign op
public:
    static SingleInstance* get_instance();                           // static instance access api
    static void delete_instance();                                   // static release instance resource 
    void print();
};

SingleInstance* SingleInstance::ptr_single_instance = nullptr;       // static data member must init ouside
std::mutex SingleInstance::singleton_mutex;                          // invoke default ctor of std::mutex

SingleInstance* SingleInstance::get_instance(){                      // double-check-lock: avoid unnecessary locking
    if(ptr_single_instance == nullptr){                              // check before lock: no singleton, then lock
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(singleton_mutex);          // lock before operate on singleton
        if(ptr_single_instance == nullptr){                          // check after lock: no singleton, then create
            ptr_single_instance = new(std::nothrow) SingleInstance;
        }
    }
    return ptr_single_instance;                                      // unlock by std::unique_lock's dtor
}

void SingleInstance::delete_instance(){
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(singleton_mutex);              // lock before operate on singleton
    if(ptr_single_instance != nullptr){
        delete ptr_single_instance;
        ptr_single_instance = nullptr;
    }                                                                // unlock by std::unique_lock's dtor
}

void SingleInstance::print(){
    cout << "instance memory address: " << this << endl;
}

SingleInstance::SingleInstance(){
    cout << "invoking ctor" << endl;
}

SingleInstance::~SingleInstance(){
    cout << "invoking dtor" << endl;
}
```

the lazy singleton class usecase code is the same as the example above.  
possible output of above program can be:

```text
main function start
main(): create threads: [0]
main(): create threads: [1]
main(): create threads: [2]
main(): create threads: [3]
thread id: [thread id: [0main(): create threads: [4]
2]
]
invoking ctor
instance memory address: 0x7fa46dd04080
thread id: [3]
instance memory address: 0x7fa46dd04080
thread id: [1]
instance memory address: 0x7fa46dd04080
thread id: [4]
instance memory address: 0x7fa46dd04080
invoking dtor
invoking ctor
instance memory address: main function end0x7fa46dd04080
```

all the object are created with the same addr, so definitely only one instance is created.

$ 1 why the lazy mode singleton pattern with lock is thread safe?  
use double-check-lock to avoid race condition to operate on the ptr to singleton,
which ensure the "check & instance creation" is only accessed by 1 process.

$ 2 drawbacks of lazy singleton pattern with lock?  
in high concurrency scenarios, tons of threads will try check the ptr_single_instance==nullptr
at the meantime, they will pass the if clause, result in fierce lock contention, leading to
lower performance.

### # lazy singletion pattern with local static variable (c++11 thread-safe)
using local static variable as singleton, the lazy mode class definition:

```text
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <pthread.h>

using std::cout; using std::endl;

class SingleInstance{
private:
    SingleInstance();                                            // ctor
    ~SingleInstance();                                           // dtor
    SingleInstance(const SingleInstance&);                       // copy ctor
    const SingleInstance& operator=(const SingleInstance&);      // assign op
public:
    static SingleInstance& get_instance();                       // static method: independant of class instance
    void print();
};

SingleInstance& SingleInstance::get_instance(){                  // thread-safe (static can only declared in class)
    static SingleInstance local_static_instance;                 // local static variable as singleton
    return local_static_instance;                                // return singleton's reference
}

void SingleInstance::print(){
    cout << "instance memory address: " << this << endl;
}

SingleInstance::SingleInstance(){
    cout << "invoking ctor" << endl;
}

SingleInstance::~SingleInstance(){
    cout << "invoking dtor" << endl;
}
```

the lazy singleton class usecase code is as (no need to manually release singleton resources):
```text
void* printhello(void *thread_id_p){
    pthread_detach(pthread_self());
    int thread_id = *((int*)thread_id_p);
    cout << "thread id: [" << thread_id << "]" << endl;
    SingleInstance::get_instance().print();
    pthread_exit(nullptr);
}

const int NUM_THREADS = 5;

int main(){
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS] = {0};
    int index[NUM_THREADS] = {0};
    int ret = 0; int i = 0;

    cout << "main function start" << endl;
    for(int i=0; i<NUM_THREADS; ++i){
        cout << "main(): create threads: [" << i << "]" << endl;
        index[i] = i;
        ret = pthread_create(&threads[i], nullptr, printhello, (void*)&(index[i]));
        if(ret){
            cout << "error: cannot create threads" << endl;
            exit(-1);
        }
    }
    cout << "main function end" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

possible output of above program can be:

```text
main function start
main(): create threads: [0]
main(): create threads: [1]
main(): create threads: [2]
thread id: [0]
thread id: [thread id: [1]2
main(): create threads: [invoking ctor3]
]
instance memory address: 0x108d7b120

instance memory address: 0x108d7b120
instance memory address: 0x108d7b120
thread id: [3]
instance memory address: 0x108d7b120
main(): create threads: [4]
main function end
invoking dtor
```

static variables typically stored in data or bss segment (initialized or un-initialized).

local static variable has local scope (within get_instance function body), but its lifetime
last through the whole program. thus, no need to implement dtor for them, the os will take
care of the resource recycling.

<hr>

### # hungry singleton pattern (thread-safe)
initialized the instance variable as soon as the class got defined, the hungry mode class is as:

```text
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <pthread.h>

using std::cout; using std::endl;

class SingleInstance{
private:
    static SingleInstance* ptr_single_instance;                  // static data member (must init outside class)
private:
    SingleInstance();                                            // ctor
    ~SingleInstance();                                           // dtor
    SingleInstance(const SingleInstance&);                       // copy ctor
    const SingleInstance& operator=(const SingleInstance&);      // assign op
public:
    static SingleInstance* get_instance();                       // static instance access api
    static void delete_instance();
    void print();
};

SingleInstance* SingleInstance::ptr_single_instance = new(std::nothrow) SingleInstance;  // init once, last till end

SingleInstance* SingleInstance::get_instance(){                  // thread safe
    return ptr_single_instance;                                  // directly return the static variable
}

void SingleInstance::delete_instance(){                          // static can only be declared in class
    if(ptr_single_instance){
        delete ptr_single_instance;                              // release obj resource
        ptr_single_instance = nullptr;                           // re-assign null value to static member
    }
}

void SingleInstance::print(){
    cout << "instance memory address: " << this << endl;
}

SingleInstance::SingleInstance(){
    cout << "invoking ctor" << endl;
}

SingleInstance::~SingleInstance(){
    cout << "invoking dtor" << endl;
}
```

the hungry singleton class usecase is as:

```text
void* printhello(void *thread_id_p){
    pthread_detach(pthread_self());
    int thread_id = *((int*)thread_id_p);
    cout << "thread id: [" << thread_id << "]" << endl;
    SingleInstance::get_instance()->print();
    pthread_exit(nullptr);
}

const int NUM_THREADS = 5;

int main(){
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS] = {0};
    int index[NUM_THREADS] = {0};
    int ret = 0; int i = 0;

    cout << "main function start" << endl;
    for(int i=0; i<NUM_THREADS; ++i){
        cout << "main(): create threads: [" << i << "]" << endl;
        index[i] = i;
        ret = pthread_create(&threads[i], nullptr, printhello, (void*)&(index[i]));
        if(ret){
            cout << "error: cannot create threads" << endl;
            exit(-1);
        }
    }
    SingleInstance::delete_instance();                     // resource release
    cout << "main function end" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

possible output of above program can be:

```text
invoking ctor
main function start
main(): create threads: [0]
main(): create threads: [1]
thread id: [0]
instance memory address: 0x7ffd15c05a80
main(): create threads: [2]
thread id: [1]
instance memory address: 0x7ffd15c05a80
main(): create threads: [3]
thread id: [2]
instance memory address: 0x7ffd15c05a80
main(): create threads: [4]
thread id: [3]
instance memory address: 0x7ffd15c05a80
invoking dtor
main function end
```

that is, all the obj returned by get_instance are located at the same address, only
one instance is actually created.
