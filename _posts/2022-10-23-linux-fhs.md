### # Definition
The FHS is a reference describing the conventions used for the layout of a UNIX system. It has been made popular by its use in Linux distributions, but it is used by other UNIX variants as well.

More infomation can be found with `man hier`.

### # Root
```text
# /
# Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy
```
```text
# /root
# Home directory for root user.
```
```text
# /home
# Home directory for normal users: saved files, personal settings...
```

### # Bins
```text
# /bin
# Essential command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode
  including to bring up the system or repair it: cat ls cp ... For all users
```
```text
# /sbin
# Essential system binaries: fsck, init, route...
```
```text
# /usr/bin
# Non-essential command binaries not needed in single-user mode. For all users.
  Most programs executed by normal users which are not needed for booting or 
  for repairing the system and which are not installed locally should be here.
```
```text
# /usr/sbin
# Non-essential system binaries: daemons for various network services...
```
```text
# /usr/local/bin
# Contains binaries of third-party apps installed, Any local executable that
  didnt come with the linux may get its place here.
```
```text
# /usr/local/sbin
# Same is the case with /usr/local/bin, which contains binaries for root.
```

### # Vars
```text
# /var
# Variable files: files whose content is expected to continually change during
  normal operation of the system: logs, spool files, temporary e-mail files.
```
```text
# /var/run
# Run-time variable data. This directory contains system information data 
  describing the system since it was booted.
# In FHS 3.0, /var/run is replaced by /run: a system should provide a 
  /var/run or provide a symbolic link from /var/run to /run for compatibility.
```

### # Others
```text
# /mnt
# Temporarily mounted file systems.
```
