### # enable root privilege (macos)
the root privilege is disabled on macos by default, so the following steps to enable it (tested on my mbp2015 with os: bigsur 11.6).

```text
1 from finder, goto document
2 cd /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/
3 open "mulu shiyong gongju"
4 enable/disable root privileged users
5 set passwd (donghao) 
```
