(1) why we need dssign pattern?  
the relationship between design patterns and object-oriented software design
are the similar to the relationship between data structures and process-oriented development.

(2) what is the goal of object-oriented software design and development?  
high cohesion within a single module and low coupling amoung system modules.
by adopting c++ advanced features:
encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, the above goal can be achieved.
