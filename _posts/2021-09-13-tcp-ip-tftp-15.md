tftp was originally used as a communication protocol for diskless systems (diskless workstations, x terminals)
during system boot.
unlike the ftp file communication protocol that relies on tcp, tftp uses udp as a carrier in order to keep the
communication datagram "simple & small".

rfc-1350 is the official specification that describes tftp-v2.
