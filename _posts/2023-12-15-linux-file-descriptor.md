everything in linux can be seen as file, the fd is the generaic handler to all things.
file descriptor (fd) can be seen as a representation of resources in linux system.

the fd is used by the kernel as references to all kinds of resources in system,
and as hook point of the address from device memory through memory map operations.

### # graphic model of the relationship among fd & fdt & ofdt

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/slothfull/cdn@main/image/fdt.pdf" width="750"/>

1 the first 3 fd stdin(0), stdout(1) and stderr(2) are special fd.
in this case, all of them point to a pseudo-terminal (/dev/pts/0).
they have no positions in open fd table due to their character device type.
thus, proc#l and proc#2 must be running under the terminal sessions.

2 normally, only open fd table entries got their own flag, however, some fd can
have per-process flags. till now there is only one such flag: close-on-exec (O_CLOEXEC).
in this case, the fd 9 of process 1 and fd 3 of process 2 are point to the same
system-wide open fd table entries.

3 even though the fd algorithm constantly reuses the fd and allocates them sequentially
from the lowest available, it doesnâ€™t mean that fd number gaps cannot occur.
in this case, the fd 9 of the process 1 goes after fd 3.
one reason could be: the files used fd 4, 5, 6 and 7 are already closed.
another reason could be: an explicit duplication of a fd using dup2, dup3 or fcntl with F_DUPFD.
using these syscalls, we can specify the wanted fd number.

4 a process can have >=1 fd points to the same entry in open file descriptions.
system calls dup, dup2, dup3 and fcntl with F_DUPFD help with that.
in this case, fd 0 and fd 2 of the process 2 refer to the same pseudo terminal entry.

5 stdout fd might point to a regular file or pipe but not a terminal.
in this case, the stdout of the process 2 refers to a file on disk /tmp/out.txt.

6 fd from various processes can point to the same entry in system-wide open fd table.
this can be achieved by fork syscall to inherit fd from parent proc to its child.

7 in this case the file path is shown for similarity, but actually kernel uses inode,
minor and major number of a device.

8 running in the shell context, 0,1 and 2 fd pointed to a pseudo-terminal.

9 multiple open fd entries can be linked with the same physical file on disk.
the kernel allows us to open a file with different flags and at various offset positions.

### # fd & fdt & ofdt structures in kernel
1 after linux abstract the tasks by thread, the fd is available inside thread's obj:

```text
struct task_struct {
    ...
    struct files_struct* files;
    ...
}
```

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

2 file descriptor table (per-process fdtable) can be found inside files_struct, it defines all the fd
managed by current kernel thread.

```text
struct files_struct {
	atomic_t              count;                         // read most part
	bool                  resize_in_progress;
	wait_queue_head_t     resize_wait;

	struct fdtable __rcu* fdt;                           // per process fd table, rcu: speed-up write to fdtable,
	struct fdtable        fdtab;                         // targeting for scenario as always read seldom write

	spinlock_t file_lock  ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp;  // written part on a separate cache line (smp)
	unsigned int          next_fd;
	unsigned long         close_on_exec_init[1];
	unsigned long         open_fds_init[1];
	unsigned long         full_fds_bits_init[1];
	struct file __rcu*    fd_array[NR_OPEN_DEFAULT];
};
```

3 open file table is a system-wide table maintaining all opened instances.
each entries in this table contains some extra file status info: file_offset, file_status\...

```text
// low-level design ideas:
// f_{lock,count,pos_lock} members can be highly contended and share the same cacheline.
// f_{lock,mode} are very frequently used together and so share the same cacheline as well.
// the read-mostly f_{path,inode,op} are kept on a separate cacheline.

struct file {
    union {
        struct callback_head      f_task_work;   // fput() uses this when close & free file
        struct llist_node         f_llist;       // fput() must use workqueue (most kernel threads)
        unsigned int              f_iocb_flags;
    };
                                                 // for security: keep f_ep, f_flags out the reach of irq context
