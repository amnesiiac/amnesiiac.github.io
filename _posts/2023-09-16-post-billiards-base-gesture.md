### # personal preference of snooker cue
1 a cue which is lighter than normal one fit me better: too much weight cue make it diffcult to pull forth and abck.  
2 a cue which is shorter than normal one fit me better: I like to grip relative closer to the center of gravity, and the back pull distance is short to make it stable.

### # personal body gesture to make the cue movement straight
1 heel of right foot should be on the aim line, and slightly deviate to right in direction.  
2 left foot line and the aim line are parallel.  
3 when lying down to aim, left leg naturally bends, while the right leg keep straight.  
4 always keep the cue close to the chest.  
5 always keep the cue under chin.

### # personal checkpoint for cue direction
1 1st & 2nd finger of left hand.  
2 chin bottom.  
3 chest.  
4 composition of thumb & 3rd & 4th finger of right hand.

all the checkpoint need to be under a soft but consistent pressure during pre-stop till after shot,
which will keep the shot line consistent with which you aim at.

### # actions for hitting the cueball close to poolside
1 first need to aim horizontally, then lift the cue bottom a bit higher.  
2 the right hand need to grip a bit ahead, and grip the cue a bit tighter.  
3 but at the moment just before hitting the cue ball, release the cue out in that short time period.

### # actions for pull & develop the cue
1 all fingers of right hands are gripping the cue.  
2 only the 3rd & 4th finger and thumb actually used to grip the cue always.  
3 when pulling back & forth, the rest two fingers gently hold, without adding even a tiny force on the cue.  
4 when pulling back & forth, all fingers are in a relaxing state (minimal strengh to hold the cue).  
5 always relax your wrist joint.  
6 make sure to pre stop, check the aim point during this.  
7 pull back and forth slowly, check the aim line & point again.  
8 make sure to post stop, determine the speed of cue during.

### # aiming methods
1 the imaginary cue ball method.  
2 directy find out the "goal point" aiming method.  
3 the pockets two corner and the target ball form two parallel lines, observe the parallels to detemine the range of "imaginary ball".  
4 aiming by your first sight to determine the aim direction.  
5 just combination of all the methods above to make sure you find the real "goal direction".
