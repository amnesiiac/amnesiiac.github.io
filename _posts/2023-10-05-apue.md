### # what is APUE?
APUE is short for advanced programming in the unix env.

<hr>

### # steps to compile & test the sample code of APUE
Fristly, we need to download the code from apue site:
```text
$ wget http://www.apuebook.com/src.3e.tar.gz     # get the right version of apue code from site
$ tar -xzvf src.3e.tar.gz                        # unzip the ".tar.gz" compressed file
```
then we could choose to compile one or all of the code by:
```text
$ cd apue.3e/                                    # inside gnerated dir
$ cd advio/ && make                              # compile only the choose chapter code
$ make                                           # compile all code samples
```
if we need to test a sample code like "Figure 14.1 Large nonblocking write" which reads:
```text
#include "apue.h"
#include <errno.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

char    buf[500000];

int main(void){
    int     ntowrite;
    int     nwrite;
    char    *ptr;
    ntowrite = read(STDIN_FILENO, buf, sizeof(buf));
    fprintf(stderr, "read %d bytes\n", ntowrite);
    set_fl(STDOUT_FILENO, O_NONBLOCK);  /* set nonblocking */
    ptr = buf;
    while(ntowrite > 0){
        errno = 0;
        nwrite = write(STDOUT_FILENO, ptr, ntowrite);
        fprintf(stderr, "nwrite = %d, errno = %d\n", nwrite, errno);
        if(nwrite > 0){
            ptr += nwrite;
            ntowrite -= nwrite;
        }
    }
    clr_fl(STDOUT_FILENO, O_NONBLOCK);  /* clear nonblocking */
    exit(0);
}
```
directly compile it will raise "file not found" error:
```text
$ gcc -o kkkkkkkkk test.c -Wall -g
test.c:1:10: fatal error: 'apue.h' file not found
#include "apue.h"
         ^~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
```
hence, assume we already download it under "/Users/mac/c3/apue/apue.3e/", we link the include and lib then compile it using:
```text
$ gcc -o out test.c -I /Users/mac/c3/apue/apue.3e/include -L /Users/mac/c3/apue/apue.3e/lib -lapue
```
finally we could test the out following steps in page 517/1034 in apue:
```text
$ ls -l /etc/services
-rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 677972 Jan 1 2020 /etc/services
```
check the stdout when executing the program:
```text
$ ./out < /etc/services > stdout
read 500000 bytes
nwrite = 500000, errno = 0
```
```text
$ cat stdout
# Network services, Internet style
#
# Note that it is presently the policy of IANA to assign a single well-known
# port number for both TCP and UDP; hence, most entries here have two entries
# even if the protocol doesn't support UDP operations.
...
```
check the stderr when executing the program:
```text
$ ./out < /etc/services/ 2>stderr
# Network services, Internet style
#
# Note that it is presently the policy of IANA to assign a single well-known
# port number for both TCP and UDP; hence, most entries here have two entries
# even if the protocol doesn't support UDP operations.
...
```
```text
$ cat stderr | head -n 10
read 500000 bytes
nwrite = 999, errno = 0
nwrite = -1, errno = 35
nwrite = -1, errno = 35
nwrite = 1001, errno = 0
nwrite = -1, errno = 35
nwrite = -1, errno = 35
nwrite = -1, errno = 35
nwrite = -1, errno = 35
nwrite = -1, errno = 35
```
